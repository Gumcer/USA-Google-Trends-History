There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > USA Google Trends History by State.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Analytics could benefit from gauging previous search queries filtered by state at a specific time frame.

## Summary ##
  > The inspiration for this is in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm91jBeN4oo&t=84s&ab_channel=V1Analytics. It is the U.S map showing state borders, and inside each of them include a specific search trend that was popular on the given month and year. If search trend is clicked on, a new window will appear that directs them to a google search of the trend clicked on.

## Problem ##
  > Google Trends currently has a lot of functionality, but finding trends by geo location of specific states becomes difficult as there is a lot of navigation in order to find that.

## Solution ##
  > I plan to conglomerate and simplify the process of accessing popular search trends by state for over 10 years into an interactable map of the US.

## Quote from You ##
  > Thank you V1Analytics for the inspiration to create this. 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Just movethe slider and you can see the the date change by month and year, and corresponding search trends for that timeline!

## Customer Quote ##
  > This product allowed me to see popular stuff I had long forgotten happened in Arkansa!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > If you would like to see a more thorough map with actual dates, please watch V1 Analytics video on it, and like and subscribe!
